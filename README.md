# ADS-B-to-ThingsBoard-with-FlightAware-Pro-Stick-Plus
This project demonstrates how real-time aircraft data (ADS-B) can be captured, processed, and visualized using IoT technologies.  A Raspberry Pi equipped with a 1090 MHz ADS-B SDR receiver collects live aircraft data, processes it in Python, and publishes selected telemetry via MQTT to an IoT dashboard (ThingsBoard).
